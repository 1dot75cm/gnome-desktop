The GNOME project was born as an effort to create an entirely free
desktop environment for free systems. From the start, the main
objective of GNOME has been to provide a user friendly suite of
applications and an easy-to-use desktop.
    </p>
    <p>
The GNOME project is proud to bring you version 2.0 of the GNOME
Desktop and Platform - we pride ourselves in ease of use,
configurability and stability which appeals to both users and system
administrators.
    </p>
    <p>
The GNOME 2.0 project is the culmination of a major effort which had
the dual objectives of dramatically improving developer productivity
and significantly enhancing the GNOME user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
GNOME is supported on a variety of platforms, including GNU/Linux
(more commonly referred to as Linux), Solaris (tm) Operating
Environment, HP-UX, Unix, BSD and Apple's Darwin.  The enhanced user
interface moves from a traditional X Window System interface to one
that is easy to use and familiar to users of other environments.
