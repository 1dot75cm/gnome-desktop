gnome-desktop
=============

	This package contains the libgnome-desktop library which
contains APIs that really belong in libgnome/libgnomeui but have not
seen enough testing or development to be considered stable. Use at
your own risk.

	Also contained here are documents installed as part of the
core GNOME distribution, e.g. the GPL, GNOME's .desktop files, the
gnome-about program, some manpages and GNOME's core graphics files and
icons.
	Please submit patches to desktop-devel-list@gnome.org or to
the people listed in the MAINTAINERS file.
