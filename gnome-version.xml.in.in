    <_p>Welcome to the GNOME Desktop. GNOME is a Free, usable, powerful,
accessible desktop environment for the Unix-like family of operating
systems.</_p>
    <_p>GNOME includes most of what you see on your computer, including the
file manager, menus, and many applications, like the web browser. GNOME also
includes a development platform to allow programmers to create complex and
powerful new applications.</_p>
    <_p>GNOME is developed by an active community of volunteers who want to
provide a desktop and a suite of user friendly applications. Because GNOME
needs documentors, translators, and many other types of people, virtually
anyone, with or without coding skills, can contribute to GNOME.</_p>
    <_p>Hundreds of people have contributed code to GNOME since it was started
in 1997; many more have contributed in other important ways, including
translations, documentation, and quality assurance. The following names are an
incomplete list of those who have contributed substantially and made GNOME
possible.</_p>
